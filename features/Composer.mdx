*New User Composer Flow*

In this example, we set up flow logic when a new user is created. The flow is triggered when a new entry is added to the users table. From there, we call the Create Wallet node to generate an EVM wallet for the user and get the user.id from the new entry. Next we call call 3 nodes asynchronously: Update Data to store the new wallet address in the users table, Transfer Pack to transfer an on-chain lootbox to the user’s wallet, and Top Off Eth to allow the user’s wallet to cover gas fees.

Available Composer Nodes:
