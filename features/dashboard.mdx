title: 'Dashboard'
description: 'The Dashboard is a frontend client for the Worldsbase backend. While all our backend is open source and accessible via REST API, we still find it very useful to control via the Dashboard.'

The Dashboard consists of:
    - A Table Editor for managing game data
    - Composer, a workflow automation tool for building on top of your game data
    - User management


## Unreal Engine
Worldsbase was built with gaming as it’s first priority. Our Worldsbase Unreal Engine Plugin allows full access to everything in Worldsbase. Still, everything is accessible via a REST API if you don’t wish to use the plugin.
