## Why use Worldsbase

Worldsbase sits on top of your data not locking you in and allows developers to use the blockchain as a database.

Worldsbase enables you to:
- Build fully-onchain applications with a no-code dashboard and REST API
- Use your own data (postgres, .xls)
- Sync and tokenize your web2 data on-chain
- Seamlessly integrate any smart contract interactions into your application via plugins or REST API
- Create workflow automations on top of your data
- Create and manage smart wallets for users
